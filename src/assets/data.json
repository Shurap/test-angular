    "content": "Coming face-to-face with either a crocodile or an alligator is undoubtedly a frightening situation. After all, they both have mouths that are packed with some seriously oversized sharp teeth, green scaley bodies, and the strength to pull their prey underwater in a mere moment. But, it's important to give respect to where respect is due in the animal kingdom, because crocs and gators couldn't be more different.",

    "content": "Since the 16th century the bear has been the ultimate symbol of Russia. Representing both the good—strength, power and sheer might—and the bad—ferocity and club-footedness—it’s perhaps the only accurate likeness of the enigma that is Russia. Over the years it’s played many roles in Russian society; from an all-wise spirit god to be worshipped to a first-class fool, forced to drink wine and wear babushka scarves, to a symbol of wealth, ruthlessly hunted for its pelt, paws and organs. Though the accounts of early medieval European travelers (which sparked the myth that Russia was a country overrun with bears) may not have been wholly true, there is truth in the fact that the bear is an integral part of Russian culture.",
